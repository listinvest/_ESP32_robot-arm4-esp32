## Hardware

- 1 ESP32 MCU 7$

- 4 Servo FUTABA M490S
- 1 DIP
- 1 Power suply 5v 2a
- 1 Litle 
- 1 Arm robot 16$ like this "4DOF Assembling Acrylic Mechine Robot Arm with SG90 Plastic Gear Servo For Robot DIY" on https://www.banggood.com/4DOF-Assembling-Acrylic-Mechine-Robot-Arm-with-SG90-Plastic-Gear-Servo-For-Robot-DIY-p-1185185.html?cur_warehouse=CN 

## Software
- Arduino IDE
- Libraries
- ESP32_Servo.h
- AutoConnect.h



This toy robot is build for learn to control by wifi one simple four arm robot, they has a web server
### You can set 
You can configure as Wifi access point or connet to your wifi, and save the configuration in EEPROM, 


## Management
In the main root page you can move each motor steep by steep or move clomplex secuences saves 

You can develop your complex movement by write to arrays of integer one  is ID of servo the second has the position to move like this
  ```
  if (steep == 3) {
    int  iMotor_03[] = {1,  2,   0} ;
    int iPosic_03[] = {86, 93, 180};
    fncDoit_takeaway_do(iMotor_03, iPosic_03);
  }
```
It say move servo 1 to 86ยบ, move servo 2 to 93ยบ and move servo 0 to 180ยบ
